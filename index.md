## New to the Spine Model?
The Spine Model can be applied to any human system and the individuals in it. If you're not familiar with the it, we recommend you [learn the basic ideas behind the model first](http://spinemodel.info).

## What is the purpose of this wiki?
When you create a Spine, instead of describing each item in detail you can just link to the relevant spine.wiki page.

This wiki catalogs each level of the model and its various implementations in a way that creates an encyclopaedia from which you can learn and to which you can [contribute](/explanation/Contribution).

## How to contribute
We welcome any contributions. See [the guidelines on how to contribute](/explanation/Contribution).
