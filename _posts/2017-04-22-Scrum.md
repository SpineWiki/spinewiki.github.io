# Origin
Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber conceived the Scrum process in the early 90’s. They codified Scrum in 1995 in order to present it at the Oopsla conference in Austin, Texas (US) and published the paper “SCRUM Software Development Process”.

Ken and Jeff inherited the name ‘Scrum’ from the 1986 groundbreaking paper ‘The New New Product Development Game’ by Takeuchi and Nonaka, two acknowledged management thinkers. With the term ‘Scrum’ Nonaka and Takeuchi referred to the game of rugby to stress the importance of teams and some analogies between a team sport like rugby and being successful in the game of new product development. The research described in their paper showed that outstanding performance in the development of new, complex products is achieved when teams, as small and self-organizing units of people, are fed with objectives, not with tasks. The best teams are those that are given direction within which they have room to devise their own tactics on how to best head towards their joint objective. Teams require autonomy to achieve excellence.

# Learning It
Our recommended way of learning scrum is through...

* [Scrum Primer](http://scrumprimer.org/) - Deemer, Benefield, Larman, Vodde
* [Scrum Guide](http://www.scrumguides.org/) - Sutherland, Schwaber

*&#42; the best way to get properly informed about any Archetype is to find people who are actively using it and to ask them about their experiences.*
