# Origin
The term XP predates the term Agile by several years. XP stands for Extreme Programming, and is a suite of Practices, Principles, and Values invented by [Kent Beck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck) in the late ‘90s.

# Learning It
Our recommended way of learning XP is through…

* [[Book] Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change, 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Change/dp/0321278658) - Kent Beck
* [What is Extreme Programming?](http://ronjeffries.com/xprog/what-is-extreme-programming/) - Ron Jefferies
* [Extreme Programming:
A gentle introduction](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/) - Don Wells

*&#42; the best way to get properly informed about any Archetype is to find people who are actively using it and to ask them about their experiences.*

# XP Spine
**From the perspective of prospective users of eXtreme Programming...**

## Need (Where might it be used?)
Extreme Programming is a discipline of software development based on values of simplicity, communication, feedback, courage, and respect. It works by bringing the whole team together in the presence of simple practices, with enough feedback to enable the team to see where they are and to tune the practices to their unique situation.
