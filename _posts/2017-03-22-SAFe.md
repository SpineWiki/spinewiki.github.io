## Origin
Dean Leffingwell describes the origin of SAFe as follows...

>Over the last few years, I’ve worked extensively with a number of other professionals (including Drew Jemilo, Colin O’Neill, Alex Yakyma, Mauricio Zamora) in the implementation of a number of large enterprise lean|agile transformations. This collaboration has resulted in many back and forth discussions around implementation of the Scaled Agile Framework™. To date, this framework has been elaborated primarily in my books Agile Software Requirements, Scaling Software Agility, and blog).<br><br>Recently, we decided to formalize our collaboration with the intent of making the framework public-facing and more readily available to a larger audience, and we have also committed to developing certain extensions and enhancements to the framework that have presented themselves as the marketplace, agile enterprise maturity, and our thinking and experiences have evolved.<br><br>To that end, we will offer the Scaled Agile Framework (SAF) as a “proven, publicly available, framework for applying Lean|Agile practices at enterprise
 scale, presented in a structured, interactive, web format.”

# Learning It
Our recommended way of learning about SAFe is through…

* SAFe has extensive [training and certification schemes](http://www.scaledagile.com/which-course/)

*&#42; the best way to get properly informed about any Archetype is to find people who are actively using it and to ask them about their experiences.*
